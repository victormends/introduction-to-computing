\section{Education: Extra-Information}

During elementary school I was always very active in my school and I acted several times as a class leader;

I got to start 4 Jr. scientific initiations by OBMEP but I completed only one due to a problem involving lack of access to the internet and devices such as notebook and cell phone (the Scientific Initiations were entirely online);

I started my undergraduate degree in Economics as a scholarship holder at CDMC, because I always wanted to understand how the world worked and why things happened and saw a way for this understanding through economics; however, over time, I discovered that I would have much more opportunities to study what I like in Data Science, so I decided to change my degree;

I have been pre-enrolled at UTFPR since the middle of 2020, but because of the pandemic I have no news of when classes will start;

\section{Awards: Extra-Information}

I also won prizes in other minor competitions involving creativity in the most diverse ways, from making furniture to cooking (at SESI and SENAI);

I won Silver Medal in a municipal writing competition, and won some other regional prizes in chess and judo .

\section{Experience: Extra-Information}

I had other experiences related to the labor market other than formal jobs:

High school at SESI is a great teamwork experience within a company; there I was also vice president of the student union.

In Junior Achievment's "Miniempresa" Program, we created and managed a company during the period of one year, our company (which I was president) ranked third in the region and among the top 10 in the state;

\section{Languages: Extra-Information}

My native language is Brazilian Portuguese, because of this I naturally understand Spanish in a basic way;

I didn’t have a good formal English teaching until the end of high school, but I learned alone enough to be leveled in book 5 of BRASAS and book 7 of CCAA, now I am studying book 6 of BRASAS and I plan to continue until the conclusion of the book 10;

I intend to study French to try to exchange in France through FGV;
