	abstract =              {With the ongoing pandemic situation, it is more important than ever to keep your Curriculum Vitae (CV or resume) updated, even if you don't think your job is under threat! Latex is a document preparation system that uses a markup language to create a document, rather than the usual graphical user interface of a word processor. It is used extensively in the fields of maths and physics, or indeed anywhere where it is necessary to typeset large numbers of equations. I wanted to create a good looking CV, so I set out to try to do so using Latex. I produced this video to show how I went about it doing it in the hope that this might be useful to at least some of my viewers! In the video I assume a basic working knowledge of Latex, as it is not intended to be an introduction to Latex itself.}

In this paper, we identify and characterize team behavior patterns based on historical matches from the very popular eSpor League of Legends web API. By applying machine learning and statistical analysis, we clustered teams' performance and investigate for each cluster how and to what extent these features have an influence on teams' success and failure. Some clusters are more likely to have winning teams than others, the results of our study helped to discover the characteristics that are associated with this predisposition and allowed us to model performance metrics of successful and unsuccessful team profiles. At all, we found 7 profiles in which were categorized into four levels in terms of winning team proportion: very low, moderate, high and very high.},

In this paper, we present a qualitative study of player practices around ranking in League of Legends (LoL), published by Riot Games and currently one of the most popular eSports games. We found that ranking is a cornerstone of LoL's competitive gaming practices, shaping the ways players distinguished and narrated their game experiences, thus engendering a culture of collaboration and competition through distinction.},

We find that this kind of toxicity: (1) is initiated by one or two players; (2) sparks from criticizing the skills of team members; (3) can be elevated by frustration with game elements and hardware; and (4) can turn into personal clashes. There is also non-toxic use of abusive language, which stresses the importance of context-aware analysis (i.e., interpreting what is actually toxic). Finally, we find evidence that the type of toxicity varies by server location, advising gaming companies to consider the location of players when setting up policies to mitigate hate speech.},

Few studies have paid attention to how temporary teams (or pickup groups) composed of strangers fulfill complex tasks. Riot Games' League of Legends, a team-based competitive online game, is played by two temporary teams. Players must collaborate with strangers in a relatively short time (about 30-50 minutes). How do players interact and collaborate with their teammates in temporary teams? To answer this question, we conducted an ethnographic study within the League of Legends community. We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with experienced players. We found that rich social interaction exists within temporary teams. Players want to collaborate with strangers through communication and coordination. They discipline their own ways of interaction to facilitate collaboration. They try to exert influence over their teammates. We further discuss design implications for facilitating collaboration among strangers.},
